# About the Norwegian UV-network
The Norwegian UV-network consists of currently 9 stations with GUV multiband filter radiometers (Biospherical Instruments inc.). Two of these GUV instruments have been operating at two other locations for some years, hence 11 stations are listed. The stations represent large variations in climatology and population density. The southernmost station is placed nearby Grimstad (Landvik), and the northernmost in Ny-Ålesund in Svalbard, as shown on the map below![Alt text](network_location.png)

## Overview
The repositories contain 11 quality controlled dose products for 9 (11) UV monitoring stations in Norway, basically for the period 1995/96 - 2021. The data are presented as 1-minute and hourly mean irradiances, and daily-, monthly- and yearly integrated doses for real sky conditions, as well as simulated cloudfree conditions. Gaps in measurement series have been complemented with modelled values, based on cloud modification factors primarily derived from nearby operating pyranometers, as well as from cloud cover observations. Where such ancillary observation data is missing, we have used cloud modification factors based on data extracted from the [STRÅNG model](http://strang.smhi.se/) of the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). The source of ancillary data used to estimate missing data are listed in the file headings.

## News
Since the previous release, gapfilling is now primarily based on pyranometer data, with 1 hour and/or 1 minute resolution. New method of extracting cloud modification factors has improved the agreement between real sky UV measurements and modelled UV data.

## Cooperating partners
The UV monitoring network is a cooperation between the [DSA - Norwegian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority](https://www.dsa.no/) (formerly NRPA), [NILU - Norwegian Institute for Air Research](http://www.nilu.no/), and the [University of Oslo](http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/). DSA is responsible for the six GUV instruments located at Landvik, Østerås, Bergen, Finse, Kise, and Trondheim, and the calibration of the network instruments. NILU is responsible for the three GUV instruments at Oslo (Blindern/Kjeller), Andøya/Tromsø and in Ny-Ålesund. The Blindern instrument is operated by the Department of physics, University of Oslo. Data from the instruments at Blindern and in Ny-Ålesund are extensively used in the national monitoring programme on the atmospheric ozone layer and natural ultraviolet radiation, financed by the Norwegian Environment Agency.

## Referencing use of UV data
Data are free for scientific, non-commercial purposes. However, use of any particular station's data must always be explicitly acknowledged (= cited) to DSA, NILU and UIO.
